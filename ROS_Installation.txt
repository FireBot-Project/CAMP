1.5 Dependencies for building packages
To install this tool and other dependencies for building ROS packages, run:
  sudo apt install python-rosdep python-rosinstall python-rosinstall-generator python-wstool build-essential

Initialize rosdep - rosdep is a command-line tool for installing system dependencies. 
Before you can use many ROS tools, you will need to initialize rosdep. rosdep enables you to easily install system dependencies for source you want to compile and is required to run some core components in ROS. If you have not yet installed rosdep, do so as follows.

  sudo apt install python-rosdep

With the following, you can initialize rosdep.
  
  sudo rosdep init
  rosdep update
